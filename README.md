A Game of Combinations — the Imtiaz - Wajid Genotype Formula
============================================================

Abstract: In this paper, we will be studying the biological concept of Heredity, with its Mathematical blend. In short, we explain that: ${}^{n}G\_{2}={}^{2n}C\_{2}-n$ is the Genotype Formula, a complete alternative to the Test Cross, to determine the total count of Genotypes of offspring, but returning no answer for the ratio of such result after I tweaked a lecture of Biology given out by Ma'am Almas Wajid.

Introduction
============

The first time the results were considered, it was a normal 2022 lecture when I first came to know about the idea of Test Cross. To pass down the comment, the idea of both Punnet’s Square and the Test Cross remains completely un-reliable to this date.

The basic idea of Punnet’s square was to give the result of multiple alleles in the form of $((n-1)^2$. Here, $n$ is a square with the most northwest part of the square as \\(\\phi\\). So, 3 would be the combination of two parental Genotypes. The following is not only hard but an insecure calculation of probability. The Imtiaz Wajid Genotype Function solves the such problem.

Formulation
===========

We carry on to simplify ${}^{n}G\_{2}={}^{n}C\_{2}-n$ for an ordinary Biologist to understand how the flow of such a model works. $${}^{n}G\_{2}={}^{2n}C\_{2}-n$$ $${}^{2n}C\_{2}-n = \\frac{(2n)!}{(2)!(2n-2)!}-n$$ $$=\\frac{2n(2n-1)}{2}-n$$ $$=2n^2-2n$$ You can refer back to the front page results of the book "The Essays on Scientific Philosophy" to see, the main results, when 3 parents make a test cross of heredity, the answer is 12, and when you apply the same 3 in the equation we make, the answer will be 12.

Combinatorial Relation
======================

The following is the mathematical affiliation of the results derived in the formulation. We can carry on the results further by the extension as follows: $${}^{n}G\_{2}={}^{2n}C\_{2}-n=2n^2-2n$$ $${}^{2n}C\_{2}-n=2(n^2-n)$$ $${}^{2n}C\_{2}-n=2{}^{n}P\_{2}$$ $${}^{2n}C\_{2}=2{}^{n}P\_{2}+n$$ $${}^{n}G\_{2}=2{}^{n}P\_{2}$$

Conclusion
==========

We end up making a new formula in the form of $${}^{n}G\_{2}$$ which helps in knowing the Test Cross total Genotype results over large datasets.
